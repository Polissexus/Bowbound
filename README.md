# Bowbound
A little game to save our time and souls in our **Introduction to Logic Systems**'s class, because it is really really boring.
The game concept is hardly inspired by the games named [Bowman](http://www.addictinggames.com/sports-games/bowman.jsp) and [Gunbound](http://www.gunbound.com/), and developed in the Unity3D engine.
